						<h3>Problem</h3>
						<p>Poverty, especially in rural regions, remains a serious problem in the Philippines. With urbanized areas often portrayed
						as hubs of economic growth and employment opportunities, people from the province have the impression that relocating to
						an urbanized area will improve their economic status and quality of living. However, with increased migration in the
						urbanized area, another series of problems arise: overcrowding, illegal settling, and increased competition for jobs,
						among others; consequently resulting in increased poverty rates in the urban area as well.</p>

						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<p>This research utilizes data science to analyze various indicators of poverty and economic disparity across the different
						regions in the Philippines. Comparisons between different regions would be made in order to determine which region, if
						any, best improves the chances of alleviating poverty.</p>

		<header><h2>Background of the Study</h2></header>
		<h5><p>More than half of the Philippines’ 100 million people live in rural areas, and more than a third of them are poor. <sup>[1]</sup>
		The government has set an ambitious target to reduce the national poverty rate to a single digit figure by 2028 as part
		of the administration’s broader strategy to boost economic growth and tackle socio-economic inequalities. <sup>[2]</sup></p>
		
		Recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority reveals a glimmer of hope. The poverty rate dropped from 23.7% in
		2021 to 22.4% in the first half of 2023. <sup>[2]</sup> Despite this progress, it means that roughly 25.24 million Filipinos
		continue to live under the poverty line. To add, poverty rates have been far from uniform across the country. Urban
		regions have a poverty incidence of 13% whereas rural areas have a much higher rate of 36%. This highlights that poverty
		is concentrated in rural regions. <sup>[1,2]</sup> Due to this disparity, a lot of individuals from rural areas are enticed to
		relocate to urban areas, in search of employment and belief that this is their ticket out of poverty. <sup>[3,4]</sup>
		
		<p>This leads us to ask: does moving to urban areas genuinely lead to better socio-economic conditions, or is this merely a
		misconception? It prompts us to examine more closely how poverty alleviation differs between urban and rural areas in
		the Philippines.</p></h5>
