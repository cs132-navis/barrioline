                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Poverty, especially in rural regions, remains a serious problem in the Philippines. With urbanized areas
                        often portrayed as hubs of economic growth and employment opportunities, people from the province have the impression that
                        relocating to an urbanized area will improve their economic status and quality of living. However, with increased
                        migration in the urbanized area, another series of problems arise: overcrowding, illegal settling, and increased competition
                        for jobs, among others; consequently resulting in increased poverty rates in the urban area as well.

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>Our solution is to utilize data science to analyze various indicators of poverty and economic disparity across the
                    different regions in the Philippines. Comparisons between different regions would be made in order to determine which
                    region, if any, best improves the chances of alleviating poverty.

            <p>More than half of the Philippines’ 100 million people live in rural areas, and more
                than a third of them are poor. 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifad.org/en/web/operations/w/country/philippines#:~:text=Overall%2C%2025%20per%20cent%20of,residents%20(13%20per%20cent)"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
                The government has set an ambitious target to reduce the national poverty rate to a single digit figure by 2028
                as part of the administration’s broader strategy to boost economic growth and tackle socio-economic inequalities.
                <a target="_blank" href="https://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/publication/public/view?slug=rural-transformation-in-the-philippines-a-development-agenda#:~:text=Poverty%20incidence%20is%20typically%20characterized,percent%20only%20(PSA%202023a)"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            </p>
            
            <p>Recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority reveals a glimmer of hope. The
                poverty rate dropped from 23.7% in
                2021 to 22.4% in the first half of 2023. <a target="_blank" href="https://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/publication/public/view?slug=rural-transformation-in-the-philippines-a-development-agenda#:~:text=Poverty%20incidence%20is%20typically%20characterized,percent%20only%20(PSA%202023a)"><sup>[2]</sup></a> 
                Despite this progress, it means that roughly 25.24million Filipinos
                continue to live under the poverty line. To add, poverty rates have been far from uniform across the country.
                Urban regions have a poverty incidence of 13% whereas rural areas have a much higher rate of 36%. This highlights that
                poverty is concentrated in rural regions. <sup>
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifad.org/en/web/operations/w/country/philippines#:~:text=Overall%2C%2025%20per%20cent%20of,residents%20(13%20per%20cent)">[1,</a>

                are enticed to relocate to urban areas, in search of employment and belief that this is their ticket out of poverty.
                <sup><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pids.gov.ph/details/why-people-will-leave-the-provinces-for-metropolitan-areas-despite-balik-probinsya">[3,</a>
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1178272">4]</a></sup>
            </p>
            
            <p>This leads us to ask: does moving to urban areas genuinely lead to better socio-economic conditions, or is this merely a
                misconception? It prompts us to examine more closely how poverty alleviation differs between urban and rural areas in the Philippines.

            </header>
            <p>To address the research questions, our group collected and preprocessed data from the 2022 Annual Poverty Indicators
            Survey (APIS) and the Labor Force Survey (LFS), which contain the latest data available regarding labor and poverty
            indicators. In order to manage these large datasets, we sampled 1,000 households out of approximately 43,000 surveyed
            from both APIS and LFS using tools such as Pandas and Numpy. We also included data regarding labor and employment from
            the 22nd edition of the Philippine Statistical Yearbook (PSY). All of these datasets are provided by the Philippine
            Statistics Authority (PSA).</p>
        
            <p>For the first research question, the data from APIS will be used. This dataset
                contains nationwide indicators of poverty
                and records of government assistance per household. First, we will determine the economic status of each
                household by
                looking at the following variables: region, family size, monthly income and monthly food expenses, and
                urban/rural
                status. Once a family’s economic status is determined, the government assistance received per household will be
                examined
                to see if it is enough to help alleviate financial issues.</p>
        
            <p>In addressing the second research question, the LFS dataset will be used. This survey
                is a nationwide survey of
                households that analyzes employment status. The researchers will be focusing on the following variables: region,
                urban/rural status, sex, age, and marital status, as well as employment-specific variables such as job status,
                reasons
                for not seeking employment, and whether individuals are Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW). These variables will be
                used to
                determine the effect that region has on the type of employment Filipinos have.</p>
        
            <p>Aside from those mentioned, basic daily wage pay is another variable that we will be
                using to answer the second research
                question. We will be using a table from the PSA OpenSTAT database entitled “Average Daily Basic Pay of Wage and
                Salary
                Workers by Major Industry Group, Philippines: 2016 to January 2024 (in peso).” and “Table 9: Employed Persons by
                Region
                and Major Industry Group, Philippines: 2018 to 2021” from the Philippine Statistical Yearbook. We will refer to
                the data
                from 2018-2021 in order to visualize how the average daily wages and employment per industry now differs from
                the years
                before.
