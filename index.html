                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Poverty, especially in rural regions, remains a serious problem in the Philippines. With urbanized areas
                        often portrayed as hubs of economic growth and employment opportunities, people from the province have the impression that
                        relocating to an urbanized area will improve their economic status and quality of living. However, with increased
                        migration in the urbanized area, another series of problems arise: overcrowding, illegal settling, and increased competition
                        for jobs, among others; consequently resulting in increased poverty rates in the urban area as well.

                    different regions in the Philippines. Comparisons between different regions would be made in order to determine which
                    region, if any, best improves the chances of alleviating poverty.

            <p>More than half of the Philippines’ 100 million people live in rural areas, and more
                than a third of them are poor.

                The government has set an ambitious target to reduce the national poverty rate to a single digit figure by 2028
                as part of the administration’s broader strategy to boost economic growth and tackle socio-economic inequalities.

            <p>Recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority reveals a glimmer of hope. The
                poverty rate dropped from 23.7% in
                2021 to 22.4% in the first half of 2023. <a target="_blank" href="https://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/publication/public/view?slug=rural-transformation-in-the-philippines-a-development-agenda#:~:text=Poverty%20incidence%20is%20typically%20characterized,percent%20only%20(PSA%202023a)"><sup>[2]</sup></a> 
                Despite this progress, it means that roughly 25.24 million Filipinos
                continue to live under the poverty line. To add, poverty rates have been far from uniform across the country.
                Urban regions have a poverty incidence of 13% whereas rural areas have a much higher rate of 36%. This highlights that
                poverty is concentrated in rural regions. <sup>

            </header>
            <p>To address the research questions, our group collected and preprocessed data from the 2022 Annual Poverty Indicators
            Survey (APIS) and the Labor Force Survey (LFS), which contain the latest data available regarding labor and poverty
            indicators. In order to manage these large datasets, we sampled 1,000 households out of approximately 43,000 surveyed
            from both APIS and LFS using tools such as Pandas and Numpy. We also included data regarding labor and employment from
            the 22nd edition of the Philippine Statistical Yearbook (PSY). All of these datasets are provided by the Philippine
            Statistics Authority (PSA).</p>
        
            <p>For the first research question, the data from APIS will be used. This dataset
                contains nationwide indicators of poverty
                and records of government assistance per household. First, we will determine the economic status of each
                household by looking at the following variables: region, family size, monthly income and monthly food expenses, and
                urban/rural status. Once a family’s economic status is determined, the government assistance received per household will be
                examined to see if it is enough to help alleviate financial issues.</p>
        
            <p>In addressing the second research question, the LFS dataset will be used. This survey
                is a nationwide survey of households that analyzes employment status. We will be focusing on the following variables: region,
                urban/rural status, sex, age, and marital status, as well as employment-specific variables such as job status,
                reasons for not seeking employment, and whether individuals are Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW). These variables will be
                used to determine the effect that region has on the type of employment Filipinos have.</p>
        
            <p>Aside from those mentioned, basic daily wage pay is another variable that we will be
                using to answer the second research question. We will be using a table from the PSA OpenSTAT database entitled “Average Daily Basic Pay of Wage and
                Salary Workers by Major Industry Group, Philippines: 2016 to January 2024 (in peso).” and “Table 9: Employed Persons by
                Region and Major Industry Group, Philippines: 2018 to 2021” from the Philippine Statistical Yearbook. We will refer to
                the data from 2018-2021 in order to visualize how the average daily wages and employment per industry now differs from
                the years before.
            </p>

            <p>Lastly, to show the overall impact and relevance of the study, we used the following data from the Philippine Statistics
                Authority: “Table 6a: Magnitude of Poor Population with Measures of Precision, by Region, Province, and Highly Urbanized
                Cities 2018, 2021, and 2023” from the Philippine Statistical Yearbook and “Table A. Total Population, Urban Population,
                and Percent Urban by Region, Province, and Highly Urbanized City” from the 2020 Census of Population. These were used to
                visualize the magnitude of the poor population in comparison to the total population per region. The regions were
                classified as either urban or rural based on their level of urbanization (>50%) stated.

                <p>The plot consists of a bar graph depicting the total population per region and a line graph showing the magnitude of
                poverty per region. The data on the level of urbanization of each region was utilized to classify areas as either urban
                or rural. As seen in the bar graph, urban regions have a higher overall population. One of the reasons could be due to
                the influx of individuals moving to cities in search of better employment opportunities. However, urban regions also
                have a larger number of residents living in poverty. This suggests that for all opportunities urban regions provide, it
                also comes with major challenges, such as higher cost of living, trapping Filipinos in poverty. On the other hand, rural
                areas, while having smaller populations, tend to experience less poverty. Overall, this graph shows the need for
                effective poverty alleviation programs that specifically address the diverse and complex challenges faced in urban and

                <p>Daily life in the Philippines will be difficult if there is insufficient access to utilities such as electricity and
                water. Through this graph, we check if there is a difference in the availability of essential amenities between urban
                and rural areas and find out which area may need more assistance. Using data from the 2022 Annual Poverty Indicators
                Survey, we discover what percent of households have sufficient access to water, electricity, internet, and public
                transportation. For water and electricity, we observe that rural and urban areas have high access to such utilities and
                have little difference between them. For broadband internet, we notice that it is more prevalent in rural households,
                meaning that there could be a problem with distribution in urban areas and assistance may be needed. For public
                transportation, the graph suggests that rural areas must give more importance in giving access to public transport in
                order to close the gap between urban and rural areas in this sector.</p><br>
                <h3> Hypothesis Testing</h3>
                <h4 style="line-height:3">Preprocessing</h4>
                <p>From the "2021 Family Income and Expenditure Survey" of the Philippines Statistics Authority, we isolated three
                    columns:
                    URB, TOINC, and TOTEX. URB is whether the household surveyed is in an urban (1) or rural (2) area. TOINC is the
                    total
                    income (in pesos) of the household in 2021, and TOTEX is the total expenditure. Using data from "Highlights of the 2021 Full Year Official Poverty Statistics" 
                    of the PSA, we see that the poverty threshold is
                    12,030 pesos per month, or 144,360 pesos per year. Using this number, we filter out the households to those under
                    the
                    poverty line. Then, we checked whether the household has a higher income than expenditure (meaning that savings are
                    increased) and store the result as a boolean in the table. The counts of this variable are what is tested for
                    independence.</p>
                
                <h4 style="line-height:3">Results</h4>
                <p>After preprocessing, we get this contingency table:</p>
                <img src="images/rq1-table.png" width=600px class="center">
                <p>When we perform the chi-square test of independence on this data, we get a p-value of <strong>2.3759450908147093 x 10<sup>-17</sup></strong>.
                    This
                    is less than the 0.05 significance level, meaning that we <strong>reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative
                    hypothesis. </strong></p><br>
                <h4 style="text-align:center;font-size: 19px">Thus, <strong style="color:green">one area is more likely to successfully alleviate poverty compared to the other.</strong></h4>
                <br>
                <p>This means that urban and rural areas are not on the same level in terms of capability of alleviating poverty. This
                result may have stemmed from the difference in access to basic necessities. As seen in the data visualization for RQ 1,
                there is a gap between urban and rural areas in terms of accessibility to some utilities. Note that further testing will
                be done to confirm the cause.</p>

                        each
                        major industry group per region. The regions are further clumped into their respective island groups: Luzon,
                        Visayas,
                        and Mindanao. The top three most populated industries are agriculture, construction, and trade & repair; with
                        Luzon
                        having the most number of employees of the three regions in total. This information is crucial in recognizing
                        the
                        employment opportunities that are available for respective industries in different regions.</p>
